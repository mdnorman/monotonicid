  This PR implements a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on pull requests to
  ensure code quality and build integrity.

  ## Changes Made:

  ‚Ä¢ Added  workflow file
  ‚Ä¢ Created task documentation in
  ‚Ä¢ Updated project guidelines with explicit branch management requirements

  ## Walkthrough

  A new GitHub Actions workflow for validating pull requests was introduced,
  including steps for installing dependencies, linting, testing, and building
  with pnpm and Node.js 18. Documentation was updated to clarify task
  branching guidelines and to add a new task document detailing the
  requirements for the workflow. The package manager version in package.json
  was also updated from pnpm 8.15.0 to 9.14.2.

  üßπ Nitpick comments (5).junie/guidelines.md (2)
  38-41: **Clarify branch-naming rule & default branch reference**

  The bullets correctly mandate a task branch, but:

  1. The example uses kebab-case (task/03-update-guidelines) while the rule
  text says ‚Äúbrief-description.‚Äù  Spell out that lowercase-kebab is required
  to avoid future bikeshedding (task/<num>-<kebab-desc>).
  2. You state ‚Äúmain branch,‚Äù but some repos still default to master.  Add a
  short note such as ‚Äú(assumes main is the default branch)‚Äù to prevent
  confusion when consumers fork.

  --------

  55-55: **Tone down the all-caps & make scope creep explicit**

  Writing ‚ÄúNOT‚Äù in caps is easy to misinterpret as shouting.  Consider softer
  phrasing (‚Äúis not considered a new task‚Äù) and explicitly call out that edits
  must stay on the **same** branch / PR to avoid scope creep.
  .github/workflows/pr.yml (2)
  20-24: **Reuse setup-node cache instead of a separate pnpm-store step**

  actions/setup-node@v4 supports cache: 'pnpm', which automatically handles
  the
  store directory and lock-file keys. This removes ~15 lines and one external
  action:

    -      - name: Setup Node.js
    -        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    -        with:
    -          node-version: '18'
    +      - name: Setup Node.js
    +        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    +        with:
    +          node-version: '18.20.0'
    +          cache: 'pnpm'

  You can then drop the ‚ÄúGet pnpm store directory‚Äù and ‚ÄúSetup pnpm cache‚Äù
  steps‚Äîsimpler, faster, less to maintain.

  --------

  38-40: **Add **--strict-peer-dependencies** to install for earlier failure**

  pnpm install --frozen-lockfile is good, but CI should also fail when peer-
  dependency mismatches slip in:

    -        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    +        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --strict-peer-dependencies

  Pre-emptively catching broken peer ranges saves painful debug sessions
  downstream.
  tasks/02-github-actions.md (1)
  17-18: **Mirror the ‚Äúpin exact versions‚Äù rule in the implementation notes**

  The doc emphasises fixed versions for dependencies but doesn‚Äôt mention
  GitHub Actions versions.  Add a sentence noting that Actions and Node
  versions must also be pinned (see guidelines update above) so the task
  description stays self-contained.

  38-42: **Branching section is clear‚Äîconsider adding commit-/PR-naming
  conventions**

  The new branching rules are straightforward and actionable. To complete the
  workflow story, consider adding one extra bullet immediately after the
  branch‚Äênaming rule that specifies recommended commit message or PR title
  conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits or ‚Äúfeat/fix/chore‚Äù) so automated
  changelog tooling and reviewers get consistent metadata.
